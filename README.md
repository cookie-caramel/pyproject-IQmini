# pyproject-IQmini
A tile-based puzzle game with auto-solving functionality. Designed as a school project for practicing path-finding algorithms and UI logic implementation.

## Features
- 5x5 tile grid with obstacle support
- Block rotation and placement
- Real-time solvability hint system
- Simple GUI (Pygame)
- Save and load possible
- Score Board

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pygame, json

## Auto-solving System
The solver uses backtracking with constraints (illegal positions, shape matching, and dead-end pruning).

## How to Run
python main.py
